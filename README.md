## Description 

    Creating a Recipe Finder App named 'ðŸ¥˜ FlavorQuest' using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We will be utilising TheMealDB APIs to create a list of recipes from a main ingredient and also give the user a random recipe. We are also using a third-party API for autocomplete.

## User Story

As a developer, we want to solve the problem of:

**Full-time worker:**
    I want to be able to create a recipe with the ingredients that are left in my fridge so that I can make a quick homemade recipe after a long day at work.

**A student:**

    I want to be able to create a recipe with the ingredients that I have left towards the end of a food shop so that I can make a quick recipe after a full day of lectures.




## Acceptance Criteria

    * It's done when, on window on-load, input form is presented to enter the ingredient name and search button. Along with it, a Random Recipe button is visible.

    * It's done when I start entering the ingredient name, an autocomplete comes up with the help of API call.

    * It's done when I enter the ingredient name and click the 'Search' button, recipes are shown with that ingredient.

    * It's done when I click the 'See Recipe' button, a pop-up appears which gives an elaborate description of the whole recipe.

    * It's done when I click the 'Go Back' button and it returns to the main page.

    * It's done when I click the Random Recipe button, a random recipe appears mentioning which cuisine, and when clicked, a YouTube channel is opened showing the recipe

## Challenges

    * The most difficult challenge we faced was in git merge. It was done many times.
